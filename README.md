# todolist
This is a project i built for fun. It majorly allows users to add their tasks incase they worry that they'd forget them and also keep track on tasks completed or not completed. When a user completes a task, they can mark them DONE or NOT DONE. When marked DONE, it will turn GREEN and RED for NOT DONE.  It also keeps a summary of tasks that the user has done by Month, Date and Year.
